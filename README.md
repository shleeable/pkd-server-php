This is the reference implementation for the server-side component of the
[Public Key Directory specification](https://github.com/fedi-e2ee/public-key-directory-specification),
written in PHP.

**[Project Website: publickey.directory](https://publickey.directory)**

## What is this, and why does it exist?

The hardest part of designing end-to-end encryption for the Fediverse, as with most cryptography undertakings, is key
management. In short: How do you know which public key belongs to a stranger you want to chat with privately? And how
do you know you weren't deceived?

Our solution is to use **Key Transparency**, which involves publishing all public key enrollments and revocations to an
append-only ledger based on Merkle trees. This allows for a verifiable, auditable log of all key-related events,
providing a strong foundation for trust.

This project, and the accompanying specification, are the result of an open-source effort to solve this problem.
